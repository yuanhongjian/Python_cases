Here are some basic Python cases I've done.

#### 1. Tianji's strategy in horsing

I use the same strategy as that in the famous ancient story to make a game of battle between player and enemy, in which the user(player) can choose the sequence of his solders with different "life" and "attack" (which are decided randomly) to battle with the enemy.

#### 2. Paper/Scissor/Stone

The strategy of it is similar to case1.

#### 3. HR system

This is a system that a HR can use to record the name, the salary and the kpi of one of the employees and also there is a rating of kpi. (Classmethod)

#### 4. Score recording system

This is a system used to record the students' scores of exams.

#### 5. Taxi_fare_calculation

This is a system used for taxi drivers to calculate the fares as they wish.
