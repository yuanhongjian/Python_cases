# Python_small_cases
Here are some Python cases I've done during learning Python

1. Tianji's strategy in horsing

I use the same strategy as that in the famous ancient story to make a game of battle between player and enemy, in which the user(player) can choose the sequence of his solders with different "life" and "attack" (which are decided randomly) to battle with the enemy.

2. Paper/Scissor/Stone

The strategy of it is similar to case1.
